Hey there,  
Thanks for stopping by. I'm Mario and I'm currently a PhD candidate in neuroscience studying Alzheimer's disease. 

Research in lab sciences involves 90% failure and 10% success. As I'm trudging along in grad school, I figured I might as well do something to counterbalance the experiments in lab.  

And thus baking. I get to scour the web for protocols, then find the best aspects and combine and test, changing single variables to find the optimal conditions.  
**Yay science!**

Ever since starting to bake two years ago, I realized it's pretty fun and actually works! Plus I get to incorporate my forgotten love of art.

*Also,* why Mario'z Eats? Mario's Eats was taken on Instagram 😂😝.
