Hey there,
Thanks for stopping by. I'm Mario and I'm currently a PhD candidate in neuroscience studying Alzheimer's disease. 

Research in lab sciences involves 90% failure and 10% success. As I'm trudging along in grad school, I figured I might as well do something to counterbalance the experiments in lab.  

And thus baking. I get to scour the web for protocols, then find the best aspects and combine and test, changing single variables to find the optimal conditions. **Yay science!**

Ever since starting to bake two years ago, I realized it's pretty fun and I finally get to utilize art.  
Follow my progress on here and [Instagram](www.instagram.com/mariozeats) and hope you enjoy!  
-Mario

Also, why Mario'z Eats? Mario's Eats was taken on Instagram 😂😝.
