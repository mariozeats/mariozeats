*UPDATE 2019* I now use 55 g almond flour, 50 g powdered sugar, 45 g egg whites, 45 g granulated sugar and bake for 25 min at 285F. See my notes in my [General Macarons Recipe](https://www.mariozeats.com/post/macarons/) for the most up to date.  

**Update Jan 2020**, lately I've been doing 305F for 20min. once again you just nead to learn your oven (going to leave this recipe at 285 though). See my notes in my [General Macarons Recipe](https://www.mariozeats.com/post/macarons/) for the most up to date.  

I'm a fan of banana and a banana ganache is able to bring in tons of banana flavor. A bit harder to cut the sweetness of the white chocolate, but really not that bad. The banana flavor comes through strongly. 

**1. Macaron Shells:**  *For about 10 1.5 inch macarons* 

- 46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
- 43 g powdered sugar    
- 35 g egg whites (room temp)  
- 25 g granulated sugar  

1. Oven to 325F. Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. I speed warm up my egg whites by putting them in a small container and then putting that container in a bowl with hot water. Takes about 5 min to bring up the temp and doesn't cook them.  
Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks.  
3. Macaronage. Look up on Youtube if you're unfamiliar on how to do so.   
    - Fold about half your dry ingredients into the meringue until just incorporated and then add the rest and continue folding until just incorporated.  
    - Add yellow gel food coloring and fold until you get a lava like consistency. Fold by scraping along the edge of the bowl to deflate the meringue a bit and then scooping the batter. Repeat. You should be able to pick up the spatula and have the batter fall down in a ribbon. The ribbon should incorporate back into the main blob after about 10ish seconds. If it doesn't fall correctly, I do a few more folds.  
    - Put the batter into a piping bag with a round tip.    
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times. Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up.     
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat a bit and dry the shells using the oven heat. I do this by opening the oven door and setting down a folded kitchen towel down on the open door and resting the tray on it. I then use something to fan the oven heat over the macarons. I do this for about a minute or two, rotate the tray and fan for another minute or two. I set it aside for a few minutes and repeat. Note, while this quickly dries out the shells, the feet will be smaller than if you dry it on its own on the counter. Ultimately though, it's helpful and makes a skin without having to wait > 30 minutes at room temp (especially if it's humid!) :p.   
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Make sure it doesn't shine and you're probably good to go.   
6. For my oven, I bake for 9 minutes at 315F and drop to 300F for another 9 minutes. Learn how your oven works though. You may have to adjust temps and time :o.  

**2. Banana Ganache**  

- 25 - 30 g banana puree (1 banana pureed, reduced)   
- 70 g white chocolate      

1. First puree a banana and then reduce until not liquidy (around 15 minutes on low heat).  
2. Put the white chocolate over a double boiler and mostly melt. Take off double boiler when there are a few unmelted pieces remaining.   
3. Add 25 g of the banana puree to the white chocolate and let sit a short time and then fold together until incorporated. It'll be a bit runny at this point.  
4. Transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge or freezer for a short while to firm up.  
5. Set aside some puree into a small piping bag/ bag with small tip.  
6. I brushed the shell with some silver paint made with edible silver dust + a few drops of vodka (will dry much more quickly than just water). You can do whatever design or no design though. :p.
7. Pipe the ganache onto the shells and then go back and add a puree center.

8. Assemble macarons and let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!   
Gluck!
