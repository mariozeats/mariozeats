Flan is one of the easiest things to make, so why not flavor it! Here's a simple recipe for a matcha flavored one. Any flavoring works (or none at all) and it's super delicious.

**1. Caramel (dry):**
- enough granulated sugar to coat the bottom of your pan  (~60-100g?)
1. Add sugar to a saucepan and heat on high.
2. Leave alone and then when it starts melting, you can mix to make sure it's heating evenly.
3. Once it has reached a nice level of carmelization, pour into the bottom of your pan.

**2. Matcha Custard:**
- 5 eggs
- can of condensed milk (400 g/14oz)
- that can, filled with water (300 -325 g)
- 6 - 10 g matcha (you need a lot since the egg is so strong)
1. Preheat oven to 350F. 
2. Bloom the matcha by first adding a bit of water. This ensures there won't be any clumps.
3. Add eggs, condensed milk, water, and bloomed matcha into a bowl and mix thouroughly. Strain once everything is fully mixed. 
4. Pour stained mixture into your pan and bake in a water bath for 1 hour, or until you can touch the top of the custard.
5. For the water bath, just find a larger pan and make sure your custard pan is about 1/2 submerged in water.
6. Once cooled, scrape alone the perimeter of the pan, place your serving plate on top, then flip.
7. Enjoy!
