I recently tried ![Sift & Simmmer's Matcha Brochi recipe](https://www.siftandsimmer.com/matcha-brownie-mochi-brochi/) and wanted to try it again with a different flavor, using the things I learned from the first time. I had mentioned in my Instagram comments that I wanted to try passionfruit, so I went for it! Topped it off with different things. My favorite was the raspberry powder! Here's the adapted recipe. It's a brochi, I guess, but I'll call it mochi here :p.  

**Passionfruit Mochi:**   

- 165 g rice flour  
- 160 g granulated sugar  
- 5 g baking powder  
- 16 g vegetable oil  
- 1 large egg  
- 240 g milk  
- 10 g reduced passion fruit puree (more is probably fine, depending on how reduced your puree is)  
- pinch of salt  

1. Preheat oven to 350 F.  
2. Line your baking pan with parchment paper. I used a 4 in x 8 in and they were decent sized, height-wise.  
3. Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.  
4. Mix the wet ingredients together in a different bowl.  
5. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, a little a time, until completely mixed.  
6. Pour batter into the pan and rap down a few times to release any bubbles.  
7. Bake for about 45 minutes until a toothpick goes in and out cleanly.  
8. Invert pan and let the mochi cool a bit.

**Finishing Up:**  

1. Take a sharp knife and cut the mochi into squares. It's sticky, so flour/ butter your knife before each slice. I actually had to wash it between each slice so that it would cut cleanly.  
2. Add your topping of choice. I tried bruleeing some sugar (a little and a lot). This kind was just meh.  
3. Also tried sifting matcha, freeze dried raspberry powder, freeze dried banana powder, and powdered sugar.  
4. My favorite was the raspberry!  

Enjoy!
