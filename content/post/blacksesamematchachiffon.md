![Black Sesame Matcha Chiffon Cake](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4212/35905895225_886436d095_h.jpg)

I recently saw some adorable little chiffon cake pans and bought a few. I knew the center would be the perfect vessle for a type of filling. Decided on a mousse. For this particular one, I set it a bit too much for my liking, but was still really happy with the flavor. The mousse is super liquidy when you first prepare it. But after a short while in the fridge/ freezer, it firms up nicely. It becomes a great texture after being in the fridge overnight. But yeah, this mousse was great and I'll definitely use this recipe again. The mousse recipe was from [The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/matcha-green-tea-mousse-2031119) and the chiffon cake was adapated from [Just One Cookbook](http://www.justonecookbook.com/green-tea-chiffon-cake/).

**1. Black Sesame Chiffon Cake:** *[Makes six ~3 in chiffon cakes (or one ~7 in cake)]*

- 3 large eggs, seperated
- 50 g granulated sugar (1)
- 40 g vegetable oil
- 60 g water
- 75 g cake flour
- 25 g black sesame powder (though you can probaby add more!)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 36 g granulated sugar (2)

1. First, preheat over to 340F. 
2. Whisk egg yolks and sugar (1) together and then add oil and water. Mix well.
3. Sift cake flour and baking powder and add in black sesame powder and mix together.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in thirds. Stir/ whisk and combine well after each addition.
5. Now make the meringue. Whisk on low until egg whites are frothy and add half of the sugar (2). Move up to high and add the remaining sugar (2). Whisk to stiff peaks.
6. Add 1/3 of meringue mixture into the cake batter and mix until combined well.
7. Now gently fold in the remaining meringue, being careful not to get rid of all the air. 
8. For my small 3 inch chiffon pans, I added 70g of batter to each pan. Tap the pan down a few times to get rid of any air bubbles.

9. For small pans, bake on a baking sheet for 15 minutes. For the 7 in pan, bake for 30 minutes. Check to make sure a toothpick goes in and out cleanly.
10. Cook cakes upside down. For the mini pans, large piping tips make good holders.

11. After cool, slide a thin offset spatula along the edge of the pan and the cake should fall out.
12. Set aside. 

**2. Matcha Mousse:**

- ~ 4.5 g (1/2 tbsp) gelatin
- 30 g water (1)
- 1 large egg yolk
- 50 g sugar
- 120 g milk
- 120 g heavy cream
- 3 g matcha powder (1/2 tbsp)
- 22 g water (2)

1. You'll need to prepare a whipped cream, so cool your bowl and whisk. 
2. Bloom gelatin. Add water (1) to gelatin and mix until you get an apple sauce consistency.
3. Whisk egg yolk and sugar together in a bowl. Will be relatively clumpy at this point.
4. Heat up milk in a saucepan and dissolve bloomed gelatin.
5. Once gelatin is dissolved, slowly add the milk mixture to the egg/ sugar and whisk constantly. This is tempering the mixture so it won't scramble the eggs. Consistent whisking is crucial to prevent scrambling. The mixture will be pretty runny now.
6. In a cup, mix/ whisk sifted matcha and water (2). Add this to the milk mixture. 
7. Chill in a bowl of ice or the fridge or freezer. Make sure to whisk every few minutes regardless of your method of cooling.
8. Using your chilled bowl and whisk, whisk the heavy cream to stiff peaks. 
9. Now add the whipped cream to the milk mixture. It will still seem runny. It'll set, don't worry. I whisked in the whipped cream and it was fine.
10. Chill in the fridge or freezer and whisk every few minutes.
    - Depending on what consistency you want in your cake, you can stop chilling before it's too too set.

**Assembly:**  

1. Add the chiffon cake to whatever plate you want to serve it on. I used an offset spatula along the bottom to remove them from the silpat I was storing them on. If you're making a large chiffon cake, make sure you place it onto your serving plate when you unmold it.

2. Put mousse into a piping bag and pipe into the center hold up to the top of the cake. 
3. Spread a thin layer of mousse along the top of the cake.
4. Dust with matcha powder and enjoy!  <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:31.48148148148148% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWgf8w4FzE-/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">A post shared by mario (@mariozeats)</a> on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2017-07-14T01:01:47+00:00">Jul 13, 2017 at 6:01pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>
