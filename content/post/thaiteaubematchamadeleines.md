I based my recipe from [Just One Cookbook](http://www.justonecookbook.com/green-tea-madeleine/), which covers a basic green tea one. However, I split the batter into three and added flavoring at the end. I'm not sure if that's taboo, since the recipe said don't overmix...BUT, I didn't have any issues so I think it's fine. I'll list what I did. The Thai tea, ube, and green tea amounts are for 1/3 of the batter. If you want to make just one of those flavors, multiply by 3.

**1. Madeleines: Thai tea/ ube/ green tea [18-20 total madeleines]:**

- 113 g unsalted butter + some melted butter for coating pan
- 113 g sugar
- 120 g flour (sifted)
- pinch of salt
- 5 g baking powder
- 2 large eggs (room temp)
- 15 g milk
- *For green tea:* 2.5 g matcha powder
- *For ube:* 2.5 g ube extract
- *For Thai tea:* 2.5 g thai tea powder

1. Melt butter in a small pan. Cool butter to room temp once it has melted.
2. Add sugar, flour, and sugar into a bowl. Note, if you're going to make only one flavor, add any dry ingredients now (thai tea powder or matcha powder). Whisk to combine.
3. In a separate bowl, add eggs and milk and whisk until frothy throughout. If you're making only the ube flavor, add the ube extract to this mixture.
4. Add the wet ingredients to dry ingredients and fold together.
5. Add the cooled butter and fold some more until completely blended.
6. Now, for multiple flavors, divide your batter into three (I put ~150 g of this batter into two other bowls).
7. Add in the flavoring and fold until incorporated. I tried not over over mixing.
8. Cool the batters down in the fridge for at least an hour or if you're in a hurry you can throw them in the freezer for 30 min (guilty).
9. Use a pastry brush or something to spread the melted butter onto the madeleine pan. Be generous.
10. Fill each mold with some batter. I put the pan on a scale and added in 25 g of batter. It equated to about a 1 tbsp of batter. Youtube videos online also use those small ice cream scoops as well. You don't want to overfill it.
11. Bake at 375F for 11 min.
12. Take out and let cool for a few minutes and then remove from pans and let cool further on a cooling rack.

**2. Custard: Thai tea/ ube/ green tea:**

- 1 large egg yolk
- 9.25 g corn starch
- 85 g milk
- 25 g sugar
- ~1ish gram of either thai tea powder, ube extact, or matcha powder

1. Combine egg yolks and cornstarch until fully incorporated.
2. In a saucepan, high heat, combine milk and sugar. If you're just doing one flavor for the custard, incorporate it now.
3. Bring to boil and remove from heat.
4. While whisking constantly, slowly add to bowl with yolks and cornstarch. You are tempering the egg yolks so that they won't scramble.
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan on high heat.
6. Bring to rolling boil, while whisking/ mixing constantly. The mixture will become custard like.
7. To get rid of lumps in your custard you can either sieve it through a fine mesh or use a hand blender (works like magic!). Or you might not have any lumps to begin with and then you're all set.
8. Divide custard into three and then stir in respective flavoring.
9. Add custard into a piping bag with a small tip.
Filling:
1. Make a cavity in the madeleines. I was ghetto and stabbed the bottom edge of the madeleine with a chopstick and swirled it around, making sure to not crack the entry point or the cookie itself. 
2. Pipe in the custard. You should feel pressure to stop/ see that the cookie might crack soon.
3. Enjoy the deliciousness :D.
Final notes:
It might be beneficial to make the custard first, that way you can pipe it into warm madeleines. I didn't do that and it still worked, but I figure the cookie is easier to cavitize (is this a word?) when warm.
Gluck!
