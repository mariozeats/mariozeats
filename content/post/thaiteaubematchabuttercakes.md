I first made these by accident, but loved how they turned out. Quite interesting texture and yummy (albeit, a bit sweet). They're just lava cake batter, baked all the way through!

**1. Thai Tea white chocolate base:**  

- 69 g white chocolate
- 20 g butter
- 40 g sugar
- 1 egg
- 25 g flour
- *35 g Thai tea
    -  75 g water
    -  15 g Thai tea mix  

**2. Ube white chocolate base:**  

- 69 g white chocolate
- 20 g butter
- 40 g sugar
- 1 egg
- 3 g ube flavoring
- 25 g flour  

**3. Matcha white chocolate base:**  

- 69 g white chocolate
- 20 g butter
- 40 g sugar
- 1 egg
- 6 g matcha
- 25 g flour  

1. Set oven to 450F. 
2. For the Thai tea, first boil the water and then add in Thai tea mix and let steep for 15 minutes. Strain before using.
3. Each batter is similar, so prepare using the same method.
4. Melt chocolate and butter over a double boiler (stir constantly so it doesn't get lumpy).
5. Take off double boiler. Stir in sugar and mix until smooth.
6. Add egg. Mix.
7. For Thai tea or ube, mix in the liquid ingredients now. 
8. Sift in flour (or add presifted flour). For matcha, also add in the sifted matcha. Stir until smooth and put into a piping bag.
9. Butter the ramekin fully (all the way to the top and the edges too.
10. Pipe into molds of your choosing.
11. Chill in fridge for a bit (10 min is probably fine). 
12. Bake at 450F for 15-20 minutes.
