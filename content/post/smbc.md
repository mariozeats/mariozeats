Lots of people use buttercreams for macarons. I don't because I always kill it. But I do use buttercreams for cakes if I need them to be stable (I usually prefer whipped creams since they're light and not too sweet). For buttercreams though, you should do a Swiss Meringue if you want something that's light. Never make an American one since those are all sugar! :p. They're easy to flavor as well. Literally just add whatever flavor you want to the base. I didn't adapt this recipe. I just make as is from [Liv for Cake](https://livforcake.com/swiss-meringue-buttercream-recipe/). I suggest just going to her website because you can adjust serving sizes and make US or metric! 
I'll still list it, but yeah, just go there. 

**1. Swiss Meringue Buttercream: [for a four or five layer 6in cake]**

- 4 large egg whites
- 267 g granulated sugar
- 300 - 450g butter, soft but firm, cubed

1. Place egg whites and sugar in a bowl and whisk until combined. The place over a pot of boiling water. Stand mixer bowl is optimal here.
2. Keep whisking and when the mixture reaches 160F and the sugar granules have dissolved (no longer feels grainy), take off and start whisking on high.
3. Whisk until stiff peaks (5-10min). The bowl should not be warm anymore.
4. Add in butter, cubewise and mix until smooth.
5. Separate and add in respective flavorings. 
6. If it looks like it split, don't throw it out. You can always save it. Like legit. Check out her [Liv for Cake's website](https://livforcake.com/swiss-meringue-buttercream-recipe/) for all the troubleshooting!
