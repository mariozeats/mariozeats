*UPDATE 2019* I now use 55 g almond flour, 50 g powdered sugar, 45 g egg whites, 45 g granulated sugar and bake for 25 min at 285F.

Yay for freedom. Fourth of July evokes two things for me - the flag and fireworks. Since I already made the [American flag macarons](www.mariozeats/americanflagmacarons) for Memorial Day, I decided to go for the fireworks ones! Ideally I would have had pop rocks coating the filling, but after going to ~15 supermarkets/ corner stores I failed to find any. I also procrastinated and didn't plan ahead (or else I would have just bought some from Amazon). I made a bit extra batter than normal because I knew I was going to need lots of different colors.  

**1. Macaron Shells:**  *For about 20 2 inch macarons:*  

- 92 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
- 86 g powdered sugar  
- 70 g egg whites (room temp)  
- 50 g granulated sugar  

1. You'll need to bake these at 315F. Measure out powdered sugar and almond flour into a food processor. Blitz up and make sure it's very fine (you need this or else you can't pipe out the small details). Sift and then quickly whisk and set aside. 
2. Make your meringue. I use egg whites from freshly cracked eggs (I've never really noticed a difference if I used aged). However, you do want them to be room temp. I put them in a small container and then put this container into a bowl of hot water. After about 5 minutes, the egg whites should be fine. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit at a time (so it doesn't go flying everywhere). Beat until stiff peaks. Don't add any food coloring yet.   
3. Prepare the batters. I ended up making 8 colors: black (base), red, orange, yellow, green, blue, white, and gold/tan. 
    - *a.* First incorporate the dry ingredients into the meringue so that it is just barely mixed together.   
    - *b.* Split the batter into different fractions. I weighed out about ~15 g into small bowls for the colors and reserved the rest of the batter for black.  
    - *c.* Once batter is sectioned out, add food coloring and folded until the right consistency. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you donâ€™t know how already.  
        - *In summary:* Fold by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Sometimes, I just scrape along the edge of the bowl. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon and then, incorporate back into the mass after about 10 seconds. Otherwise, I do a few more folds.   
    - *d.*  Put into piping bags. I have cheapy disposable piping bags that I use for the fine details (you want something you can clip the tip of plastic off). Only the black went into a bag with a piping tip.  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). 
    - *a*. First with the black batter, hold the tip perpendicularly at about a half inch above the silpat and pipe out a bit smaller than you would normally pipe your macarons. Rap the sheet a bit and use a toothpick to pop any bubbles.  
    - *b*. Then using your colored batters, pipe out your fireworks. I googled fireworks and tried to get inspiration from that. I think solid lines radiating out from a central point are easiest/ look nicest.  <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:35.833333333333336% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWlStIdlUUk/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">Piping out the fireworks</a> </p></div></blockquote>

5. Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl (carefully) the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up.  
6. I normally cheat and dry the macaron shells by holding the tray in the over. However, these designs are often a bit more mixed than normal (since they're squeezed through the small detail piping bags). Because of that, you should just let them dry the normal way. This is crucial. I have tried rushing to dry and they end up cracking. They need to develop a dried skin in order to rise properly. 
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. 
6. I bake for 9 minutes at 315 then rotate the pan and bake for 9 more minutes at 300.

**2. Blackberry Ganache:**  

- 8-10 blackberries, pureed and sieved
- 8 g corn starch  
- 40 g granulated sugar  
- 1 egg yolk  
- 60 g white chocolate  
- 30 g heavy cream   
  
1. Puree strawberries. I use a hand blender. Heat up in a small saucepan and reduce so it's not as liquidy. Reserve some puree off to the side (maybe 15-20 g)
2. Beat the egg yolk and add sugar and sifted corn starch. Whisk well.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up strawberry onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the saucepan and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste. [I also use the hand blender for this (makes it so much easier and the curd is so smooth)].  
4. Take off the heat and transfer to a bowl (If you have lumps, sieve.) 
5. Add cream to a pot and heat until it starts to simmer.
6. Meanwhile, add white chocolate over a double boiler and melt the chocolate until there are only a few chips that are unmelted. Take off the heat and add the just simmered cream over the white chocolate. Let sit maybe 30 seconds and then stir to melt the rest of the chocolate for the ganache.
7. Now you have to use some discretion. Incorporate some of the curd into the ganache. Your objective is that you don't want the white choocolate to overpower the strawberry and you want it to be able to be pipable. Stir in some curd into the ganache, a little at a time until you think you have the right consistency (I used about 2/3 of the curd). Now let the curd ganache chill. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge or freezer for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.  
8. Pipe the curd ganache onto the shells, then squeeze some of the puree into the center (using the reserved curd you put into a piping bag) and assemble macarons.

9. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!

Gluck!
