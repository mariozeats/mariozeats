*UPDATE 2019* I now use 55 g almond flour, 50 g powdered sugar, 45 g egg whites, 45 g granulated sugar and bake for 25 min at 285F.

Lava cakes are a simple and delicious dessert that don't take much time to make and bake. Changing up the filling is super easy as well! This recipe is for about 4ish servings. [usually 3 chocolate + inside flavor and 1 just inside flavor]. 

*NOTE 1:* This is my first time using a fruit puree in the lava cake base, so it made it a bit runny. However, chilling it in the fridge for a few minutes before piping it into the ramekin helped.

*NOTE 2:* For a white chocolate base that requires a powder instead (like matcha), use 40 g butter (instead of 20) and about 5 g of that powder).

**1. Dark chocolate base:**  

- 69 g dark chocolate
- 40 g butter
- 40 g sugar
- 1 egg
- 25 g flour  

**2. Guava white chocolate base:**  

- 69 g white chocolate
- 20 g butter
- 40 g sugar
- 1 egg
- 35 g guava puree (strained)
- 25 g flour  

1. Set oven to 450F. Melt chocolate and butter over a double boiler (stir constantly so it doesn't get lumpy).
2. Take off double boiler. Stir in sugar and mix until smooth.
3. Add egg. Mix.
4. Incorporate guava puree. 
5. Sift in flour (or add presifted flour). Stir until smooth and put into a piping bag.
6. Butter the ramekin fully (all the way to the top and the edges too.
7. Pipe the chocolate base (I go in swirls from center outward and then along the sides) to "coat" the ramekin.

8. Then pipe the guava base over this chocolate one.

9. Finally cover up the top with more chocolate base.

10. Chill in fridge for a bit (10 min is probably fine). 
11. Bake at 450F for 9.5 min (9 - 10 min). Loosen the cake by taking something thin and scraping along the sides of the ramekin and then put a plate on top and flip over.
12. Add some powdered sugar or guava puree to garnish and enjoy the deliciousness :D.

*Additional Tips:*  

1. Try a single tester one first to see if the cake is able to come out nicely. If too runny, go for another minute and not runny, then bake for less. 
2. When it's in the oven, the center should not be drooping down and should not look wet. When it finally starts to look firm and dry in the center, it's probably ready.
