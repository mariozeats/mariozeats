I had been wanting to try a matcha roll cake for a while and finally decided to give it a shot. I used [The Little Epicurean's recipe](http://www.thelittleepicurean.com/2014/03/matcha-green-tea-swiss-roll-strawberry-mousse.html) for the sponge component. Adapted it for the guava whipped cream. I love this sponge recipe. I use it for lots of my cakes!  

**1. Matcha Sponge:** *(one jelly roll sheet)*

- 112g cake flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 5 large eggs, separated
- 156 g granulated sugar
- 60 g whole milk

1. Preheat oven to 400F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.
2. Whisk together sifted flour, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a different, large bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and milk until pale.
4. Separately, whisk egg whites until medium stiff peaks (if you whisk too stiff, it's harder to incorporate).
5. Add dry mixture to wet mixture and fold together. Then slowly fold in the medium stiff egg whites. Be careful not to deflate them too much.
6. Pour batter onto the baking sheet and then rap the sheet down a few times to release any big air bubbles.
7. Bake for 8-9 minutes (a toothpick should go in and out cleanly).
8. Invert cake, remove silpat or parchment paper and let cool.Whichever side is nicer, let that side be the outside of the roll (bottom).
9. Let cool.

**2. Guava Whipped Cream:**

- 250 g heavy whipping cream
- ~1/2 - 3/4 guava, pureed and sieved 
- 2 g gelatin
- 10 ml water

1. Mix gelatin with water until apple sauce consistency.  
2. Melt until liquid, about 30 seconds in microwave if gelatin has set. 
3. Whisk together whipping cream and powdered sugar.
4. Slowly add in liquid gelatin and whisk until stiff peaks.
5. Fold in the guava puree.
6. Fold in chunks of guava.

**3. Assembly:**

1. Cut a small corner of the sheet off like: `|________| ---> /________\`  (helps with rolling)
2. Add the whipped cream onto the sheet layer.
3. Using the parchment paper or silpat that the cake had cooled on to help, slowly roll the cake up and over itself.
4. Maintain the shape until fully rolled then place rolled cake, seam side down, in fridge to chill.
5. Dust with powdered sugar or matcha or your favorite dusting before serving.
