One of the biggest uses of my blog is for me to find recipes so I don't forget them.

While I usually search to find a dessert that has a component I need, here are direct links to those base recipes:

- **[Macarons (Shells + Ganache Filling)](https://www.mariozeats.com/macarons)**

- **[Cream Puffs (Choux Pastry + Diplomat Cream)](https://www.mariozeats.com/creampuffs)**

- **[Tarts (Pate Sablee + Filling (Curd/ Cream/ Custard)](https://www.mariozeats.com/tarts)**

- **[Madeleines](https://www.mariozeats.com/madeleines)**

- **[Mousses (for mousse cakes and tarts)](https://www.mariozeats.com/mousse)**

- **[Cakes (Joconde/ Victoria/ Chiffon)](https://www.mariozeats.com/cakes)**

- **[Swiss Meringue Buttercream](https://www.mariozeats.com/smbc)**

Hopefully these are helpful! (I'm sure I'll probably get the most use out of this haha)  

Enjoy,
