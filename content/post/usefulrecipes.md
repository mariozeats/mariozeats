One of the biggest uses of my blog is for me to find recipes so I don't forget them.

While I usually search to find a dessert that has a component I need, here are direct links to those base recipes:

[Macarons (Shells + Ganache Filling)](https://www.mariozeats.com/macaronshells)

Cream Puffs (Choux Pastry + Diplomat Cream)

Tarts (Pate Sablee + Filling (Curd/ Custard) )

Egg Tarts

Basic Mousse

Cakes (Joconde/ Victoria/ Chiffon)

Swiss Meringue Buttercream

Jacond Sponge (Almond Flour based)

Chiffon

Victorian Sponge

Ganaches (for Macaon Fillings, for Drips on Cakes)
