I have 100% been loving the activated charcoal I recently bought. Yesteday I was sick and lying in bed and charcoal matcha madeleines popped into my head. The matcha and charcoal looked great together from the roll cake so I knew I had to execute these. I used the same protocol that I used for the first time I tried making stuffed madelines and it worked again and was delicious.

**1. Black Sesame Madeleines:**Â *[18-20 total madeleines]*

- 113 g unsalted butter + some melted butter for coating pan
- 113 g sugar
- 120 g flour (sifted)
- pinch of salt
- 5 g baking powder
- 15 g black sesame
- 7 g activated charcoal
- 2 large eggs (room temp)
- 15 g milk

1. Preheat over to 375F. 
2. Melt butter in a small pan. Cool butter to room temp once it has melted.
3. Add sugar, flour, baking powder, black sesame, and charcoal into a bowl. Whisk slowly to combine (slowly, so tthat the charocal doesn't go everywhere!).
4. In a separate bowl, add eggs and milk and whisk until frothy throughout. 
5. Add the wet ingredients to dry ingredients and fold together.
6. Add the cooled butter and fold some more until completely blended.
7. An important step is now to cool the batters down in the fridge for at least an hour or if you're in a hurry you can throw them in the freezer for 30 min (guilty).
8. Use a pastry brush or something to spread the melted butter onto the madeleine pan. Be generous.
9. To make filling the pans easy, I added my madeleine batter into a piping bag. Fill each mold with some batter. 
    - I put the pan on a scale and added in 25 g of batter. It equated to about a 1 tbsp of batter. Youtube videos online also use those small ice cream scoops as well. You don't want to overfill it.
11. Bake at 375F for 11 min.
12. Take out and let cool for a few minutes and then remove from pans and let cool further.

**2. Matcha Custard:**

- 1 large egg yolk
- 9.25 g corn starch
- 85 g milk
- 25 g sugar
- 3 g matcha powder

1. Combine egg yolks and cornstarch until fully incorporated.
2. In a saucepan, high heat, combine milk, matcha, and sugar.
3. Bring to boil and remove from heat.
4. While whisking constantly, slowly add to bowl with yolks and cornstarch. You are tempering the egg yolks so that they won't scramble.
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan on high heat.
6. Bring to rolling boil, while whisking/ mixing constantly. The mixture will become custard like.
7. To get rid of lumps in your custard you can either sieve it through a fine mesh or use a hand blender (works like magic!). Or you might not have any lumps to begin with and then you're all set.
8. Add custard into a piping bag with a small tip.

**Filling:**

1. Make a cavity in the madeleines. I have a piping tip that is nice in that you can stab a cavity. But, when I've made these before, I was ghetto and stabbed the bottom edge of the madeleine with a chopstick and swirled it around, making sure to not crack the entry point or the cookie itself (that worked quite well actually).
2. Pipe in the custard. You should feel pressure to stop/ see that the cookie might crack soon.
3. Enjoy the deliciousness :D.

***Final notes:***

1. It might be beneficial to make the custard first, that way you can pipe it into warm madeleines. 

Gluck!
